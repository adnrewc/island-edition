# Site Structure Contract

## Routes

| Route | Purpose | SEO Metadata | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------------|-------|
| `/` | Homepage summarizing Island Edition, blue hero, archive index | `<title>Island Edition Archive</title>`, meta description, JSON-LD `WebSite` | Includes launch/retirement timeline and CTA to browse issues |
| `/issues/{slug}/` | Individual issue page with original content | `<title>{Issue Title} · Island Edition</title>`, meta description from summary, JSON-LD `Article` | Top of page shows publication date and link disclaimer |
| `/sitemap.xml` | Search crawler guide | Auto-generated by Eleventy | Lists homepage and all issue URLs |
| `/feed.xml` | Optional RSS/Atom for archive updates | Generated when ingest runs | Shares issue metadata for subscription |

## Disclaimer Block

- Location: Immediately below issue page hero heading
- Copy: `This is an archived Island Edition newsletter originally published on {date}. Links were accurate at publication time and may no longer work.`
- Accessibility: Rendered as a `<p role="note">` with `aria-live="polite"` disabled (static content)

## Publication Date Presentation

- Format: `Month DD, YYYY`
- Element: `<time datetime="YYYY-MM-DD">Month DD, YYYY</time>`
- Placement: Above issue content, below H1 title, paired with disclaimer

## Canonical & OpenGraph Requirements

- Each page declares `<link rel="canonical" href="https://{github-pages-domain}/{path}/">`
- OpenGraph/Twitter cards share the same blue hero image sized 1200x630
- Homepage and issues include `og:type` (`website` / `article`) respectively

## Performance Budget

- HTML payload ≤ 120 KB per page post-minification
- Critical CSS ≤ 150 KB
- Hero image ≤ 250 KB (WebP preferred)
- Total blocking time ≤ 200 ms in Lighthouse mobile profile
